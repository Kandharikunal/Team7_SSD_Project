The cubicle is equipped with a desk, computer, chair, television, flower pots, doors, etc. and all these things with the external environment of a room having windows, dustbin, a vase, fan, lights etc. The door will be interactive, like on clicking door it will get opened/closed respectively also there is a video playing on TV.

## Technical Details :
We have created room using the external library of room: `"https://unpkg.com/aframe-room-component/dist/aframe-room-component.min.js"`
